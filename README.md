## Introduction

A line-following robot is a simple autonomous robot that can follow a pre-defined path, usually represented by a black line on a white surface. This project uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and adjusts the robot's direction using motor control.

## Components

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Chassis with two DC motors
- Motor driver (e.g., L298N, L293D, or any suitable motor driver)
- IR sensors (typically two or more)
- Wheels
- Power supply (appropriate for your motors and microcontroller)
- Jumper wires


## Setup and Installation

- Attach the IR sensors to the front of the robot, positioned to detect the line.
- Connect the IR sensors to the microcontroller's input pins.
- Connect the motor driver to the microcontroller and the DC motors.
- Ensure the power supply is connected correctly to the motor driver and the microcontroller.
